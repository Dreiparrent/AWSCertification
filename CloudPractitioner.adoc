== Basics

Benifits::
* Economies of Scale
// the square here
1. Agility
2. etc



Deployment Models::
* IaaS - this is aws, but really think web hosting like GoDaddy
* SaaS - this is the product
* PaaS - this is the dev tools side of things, think WordPress

Deployment Location::
This means three things:
* regions (us-east-1)
** these are physical locations
* availability zones (us-east-1a, us-east-1b...)
** this often includes multiple data centers in one sone
* edge locations (cloudfront), used for caching


- [ ] Remember the dif


== Compute Services

The spin up machine is called an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI) like AWS Linux 2, or Ubuntu

== Storage Services

=== S3

* S3 allows for versioning
* S3 has access logs as well
* S3 is a regional service but the bucket name is globally unique

//

S3 security::
1. Access Control Lists (ACLs)
2. Bucket policies
3. Access point policies

Use Cases::
* Static Websites
* Data Archives
* Analytics
* Mobile Applications

=== Availability and Durability
* S3 Standard provides eleven 9s of durability
* S3 Standard provides four 9s of availability

* This is possible because data within a region is replicated across multiple servers
* You can optionally setup cross-region duplication

=== Storage Classes
S3 Standard::
* general purpose, high availability and throughput
S3 Intelligent Tiering::
* This looks at your data and usage to automatically move your data to the most effective storage class
S3 standard infrequent access::
* This is slightly cheaper than S3 standard
* This is for infrequent access but provided milisecond access when necessary
S3 Standard One-Zone Infrequent access::
* This can save 20% compared to Infrequent Access
* This is recommended for data that can be easily recreated
S3 Glacier::
* This is for long term storage
* Data retrieval takes a lot longer
* There are 3 retrieval options, 1-5min, 3-5hr, or 5,12 hr
* Recommended for long term backups
S3 Glacier Deep Archive::
* This is the cheapest option
* This has multiple AZs, but takes 12 or 48hr
* Recommended for usage 1 or 2 times per year for things like compliance
S3 Outposts::
* This is recommended for workloads with local data access
* Or for demand that requires data to stay close to your local architecture

== Additional Storage Options

=== EC2 Storage
NOTE: All ec2 must have a root drive

This is
Elastic Block Store (EBS) or
Instance Store or
Elasitc File System (EFS)

* EBS data is persistance
** These can be transferred
** These can only be attached to one instance at once
** The cannot be attaches to another AZ without being copied

* Instance Store volumes are ephemral
** This is local storage that is physically attached to the host computer
** The data does not persist, but this is the fastest solution for storage

* EFS can be attached to multiple drives at once
** EFS is a serverless file store like google drive
** This exists across multiple regions (not just AZ)
** This is linux only

=== Storage Gateway
.A hybrid storage solution meaning local and in the cloud
This is useful for backups with low latency

=== AWS Backup
.This is a catchall service for EV2, EBS, EFS, and more.
This is usually a scheduled backup.


== Content Delivery

=== Cloudfront
.The cache service

* This is delivered directly if in the same edge location/distribution cache
* Otherwise this is cached in the edge location after requesting from the origin

Cloudfront has security like DDoS protection and IP blocking for regions

=== AWS Global Accelerator
This improves availability and latency by sending traffic through the AWS global network
to provide up to a 60% increase in latency

=== AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration
This utilizes cloudfront's edge location to increase uploads across long distances


== Networking Services

=== VPC
VPC can be peer connected, this works on the AWS private network


=== Additional Networking Services
Route 53:: the standard connection method
Direct Connect:: a physical connection to AWS for hybrid models
* This is for large datasets
* Business-critical data that can bypass the ISP
AWS VPN:: also for hybrid but also cheaper than Direct Connect bc its a vpn on the ISP
* This uses the Virtual Private Gateway on the AWS side
* This customer gateway is on the customer side


== Databases

=== RDS
* This is good for datasets that have relationships
* This is Aurora, Prostgres, MySQL and more
* These allow for read replicecas for quick reading across regions
* Useful for OracleDB

=== Amazon Autora
* This **only** supports MySQL and Postgres
* This is 5x faster than MySQL and 3x faster than Postgres
* This automatically scales
* This is managed by RDS

=== DynamoDB
* A fully managed NoSQL db

=== DocumentDB
* A fully managed MongoDB compatible db

=== ElastiCache
* In-memory datastore
* Compatible with Redis

=== Neptune
* A graph database service
* This is used for highly relational dbs like for social networks


== Migration and Transfer Services

CAUTION: more study needed

=== DMS
* Helps to migrate on premises db to AWS
* Supports homogeneous or heterogeneous migration (Oracle to Oracle, or to SQLServer)
** Oracle To Aurora MySQL
** Oracle to Oracle using EC2
** RDS Oracle to Autota MySQL


=== Server Migration Service (SMS)
When migrated, the new service is stored as am AMI


=== AWS Snow Family
This transfers **large** data from on premises to cloud (not over the internet)

* Snowcone
** The smallest of the datatransfer devices, 8TB of data, off-line or online using datasync
* Snowball
** A petabyte of data transferred in or out
** Snowball and snowball edge are used to add local processing in a disconnected or remote device (EC2 or Lambda)
*** Remember that edge supports EC2 or lambdas
* Snowmobile
** Petabytes or exobytes of data sent in a shipping container
** The data is loaded into an S3 bucket
** This includes an gps, alarms, video survailance, and a security escort

=== DataSync
Move things like S3 or EFS
10x faster than other services

Migrate onpremise using things like Direct Connect or the internet
Move across region or account with AWS Services


== Analytics

* Redshift
** The main warehouse service (supports Exabytes of data)
* Athena
** Analyze data in S3
** Considered Serverless
** Charged per query
* Glue
** Generated Extract Transfer and Load (ETL) code
* Kinesis
** Analyze real time streaming data like click streams or videos
** This is also useful for logging your analytics services
* Elastic MapReduce (EMR)
** Helps to process large data
** Dataminig, processing, machine learning, more
** Works with Hadoop which can process across multiple clusters of computers
** Works with other frameworks like apache spark
* Data Pipeline
** moves data across compute and storage services or on premise
** This can transfer on intervals or conditions
** Example - S3 to redshift
** This sends notification based on status
* QuickSight


== Machine Learning


=== Rekognition
.Automated image and video analysis.
* Image and video analysis
* Identify custom images and labels in videos
* Face and text detection in images and videos

=== Comprehend
.The AWS NLP service
* useful for sentiment

=== Polly

== Security and Compliance
TIP: Share responsibly model - the shared responsibility between you and aws
Well architected framework - 6 key concepts to lean on

WARNING: this is 25% of the exam

Shared responsibility is::
* AWS Security of the cloud
* You provide Security in the cloud


=== Well Architected Framework

CAUTION: you should know the 6 pillars

==== Six pillars
* Operational Excellence
** anticipate failure
** use IaaS
* Secuirty
** Automate security
** Use logging each
** secure each part
* Reliability
** Make sure you services can recover quickly
** Scale horizontally rather than vertically
** test all procedures
** reduce idle resources
* Performance Efficiency
** Use serverless/managed resource/architectures first
** Use multi-region services
** delegate tasks so that the team works only on necessary resources
* Cost optimization
** use only what you need
* Sustainability
** understand and measure you impact

=== IAM Users

CAUTION: EC2 has its own security groups that are separate from IAM groups

TIP: Remember the tasks that only the root user can do (TODO: double check this)

* Identities define who can access
* Access defines what users can do
** AWS Managed Policies
** Customer Policies
** Permissions boundaries
* A group is a collection of users

=== Roles
Roles can be assigned to users and services

* The user assumes a role
* Roles can be assigned from user to another AWS account

TIP: roles are like putting on a hat


=== Policies
.These are used to assign roles

=== IAM Credentials Report
.List all users, status, access, keys, and mfa

* often used for autditing and compliance


== Application Security Services
.These are software based security tools.

=== Web Application Firewall (WAF)
.Standard firewall with site to sql and site protection

* Protects agains sql inject
* Protects across cross site scripting

* Can be deployed to an EC2 in fron of the Application Load Balanceer or CloudFront

TIP: Macie is for S3

== Additional Security Servives
=== Config
.Set guardrails within

Create and audit standards within you AWS account
* Set preferred configs
* Track these across time
* Store to S3
* Can send notification when configurations change

CAUTION: test this by setting a guardrail

Example::
You have system level configurations stored in your EC2. Config can track changes to these

=== Guard Duty

== Pricing
There are 3 fundamental drivers of cost

TIP: Read the pricing White Paper

1. Compute
2. Storage
3. Outbound data transfer


=== Offer Types
1. 12 months free
2. Always free
3. Trials


==== EC2 Pricing
1. On Demand
2. Savings Plan - compute plan for usage
3. Reserved instances - commit to usage for 1 or 3 years regardless of usage
4. Spot Instances
5. Dedicated hosts


==== Lambda Pricing
1. Number of requests
2. Code execution time
3. Always free - 1million requests per month

==== S3 Pricing
1. Storage class
2. Storage usage
3. Data transfer - but within the same AWS region is free
4. Requests

==== RDS Pricing
1. Running clock hours
2. Type of database
3. Storage
4. Purchase type - on demand vs reserved
5. count of databases
6. API requests
7. Deployment type - Single or multiple AZs
8. Data transfers - inbound is free but outbound is not

=== TCO
.Total cost of ownership

> how much does it cost to transfer to AWS

> how can I  reduce my total cost of ownership


=== Application Discovvery Service
.Plan migration to the AWS cloud

=== AWS Price List API
.An API to query the price list
This can also send alerts for price changes


== Understanding Bills

=== Bugets
.Set custom bugets to alert overage of your set ammount

* Cost
* Usage
* Reservation
* Can notify
** Email
** SNS
** Chatbots like Slack

==== Billing Types

CAUTION: I think my merge broke here

* Spot
** Spot is the extra servers for AWS
** Spot can save up to 90%
** Spot is charged at the beginning of the hour
* Reserved
** This is a 1 or 3 year commitment
** This can save up to 75%
** Capacity is saved in an availability zone
** Reserved can also be bought as a convertible instance
*** This is if you want to update or upgrade OS
*** This can save up to 54%
* Dedictated Host
** Dedicated hosts are a full server
** This is generally for compliance or server based keys like microsoft
** Can save up to a 70% discount
** This is different from a dedicated _instance_ which would run _on_ a host

* Savings Plans
** This is a commitment to usage, not a host
** This is shared across multiple instances and compute plans (like lambdas)
** This can save up to 72%

==== Load Balancers
* Load balancers are different from auto scaling
* There are 4 types of load balancers
1. classic
2. appication
3. gateway
4. network

NOTE: look at these


=== Lambdas

* Lambdas have a 15 minute timeout
* Lambda is charged by compute time and request count
* Lambdas are part of the "always free"
** Even after the trial period, you get 1 million free requests

===  Coveratge and Usage Reports
.Includes the most comprehensive data about what is happening in AWS
* downlaod the report to S3
* list usage for each service catagory
* aggregate usage data on daily, hourly, or monthly level


=== Cost Explorer
.Visualize the last 12 months and forcast up to 3 months

Example::
Analize you EC2 usage over the last 7, 30, or 60 days to consider options for saving plans


== Governance Services
.Manage all of your AWS accounts

=== Organizations
.Orgnaize multiple AWS accounts under on umbrella
* Group Accounts
* Single payment for all accounts
* Automate account creation
* Centrally manage and applly access policies across accounts

The root account is called the master payer account

* This is payed for with **consolidated billing**

//

Service Control Polocies (SPCs)::
enforce permissions everyone in the organization to follow

Organization Units (UIs)::
Like IT, Shared Services, and Marketing

Member Accounts::
The standard AWS accounts that contain the AWS resources

=== Control Tower
.Sits above organizations to ensure the accounts comply with company policies

* Works with organizations by automatically setting them up

//

Example::
Disallow public write access to S3 access for all AWS accounts.
This would enable cross account securty audits or
preventing or detecting security issues through manatory or optinal guardrails

=== Systems Manager
.Visability or control across AWS resources

* Automate tasks
* group resources to take actions
* patch and run commands on multiple EC2 or RDS instances

//

Examples::
Security patch your all your EC2 instances on a schedule


=== Trusted Advisor
Real time guidence to help provision resources based on AWS best practivces

Examples::
* Check for unrestricted access on EC2 ports
* Check S3 buckets for public access
* Check for MFA on the root account
* Check IAM password policy {fn-be}
* RDS public access
* Service usage over 80% of the limit {fn-be}
* Exposed access keys {fn-be}
* Cloudfront delivery optamization {fn-be}

=== Lisence Manager
